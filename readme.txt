== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. Does this software require that I install an app on my phone?
No, you are not required to do so: you can always use the Psygraph web interface.  
However, a free phone app is provided for both iOS and Android, and it is able to
collect data like velocity measurements and GPS locations which are not available 
from a web browser (unless you shake your computer very, very hard).

== Donations ==
Donations are gladly accepted.
